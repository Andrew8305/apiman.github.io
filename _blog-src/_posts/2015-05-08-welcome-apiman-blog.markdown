Welcome everyone to the new apiman blog!  I know, it's pretty crazy that we haven't created
a blog until now.  But we've been pretty busy writing the software.  But now is the time!
Mostly because I finally thought of some things I wanted to write about.

<!--more-->

Now the *real* question is:  "Does anyone want to read it?"

We'll find out in the future, I guess!  We will try to use this space to write interesting 
things about what we're doing, what we're planning, and how to best make use of apiman.
The content on this blog should complement the guides, tutorials, and other materials we
already include on the site.  Of course, you should expect a little bit more casual tone
here. :)

As always, thanks for your interest in apiman.
